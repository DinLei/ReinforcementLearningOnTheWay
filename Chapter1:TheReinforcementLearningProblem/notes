1. Reinforcement learning problems involve learning what to do —
how to map situations to actions—so as to maximize a numerical reward signal

2. Beyond the agent and the environment, one can identify four main subelements of
a reinforcement learning system: a policy, a reward signal , a value function, and,
optionally, a model of the environment.
